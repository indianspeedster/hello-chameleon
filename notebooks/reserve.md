### Exercise: reserve resources

Whenever you run an experiment on Chameleon, you will

1. Open a Python notebook, which includes commands to reserve the resources (VMs, bare metal servers, or networks) that you need for your experiment. Run these commands.
2. Wait until the resources in your experiment are ready to log in.
3. Log in to the resources and run your experiment (either by executing commands in the notebook, or by using SSH in a terminal and running commands in those SSH sessions).

Also, when you finish an experiment and have saved all the data somewhere safe, you will _delete_ the resources in your experiment to free them for use by other experimenters.

In this exercise, we will reserve a resource on Chameleon.
