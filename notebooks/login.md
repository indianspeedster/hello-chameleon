## Exercise: log in to resources and execute commands

In this exercise, we'll practice running commands on the VM resource by opening an SSH session in a local terminal and running commands in that session.

### Log in over SSH from local terminal

To log in to the VM over SSH, you will:

* open your terminal application,
* run the cell below, which will print an SSH login command,
* copy this command and make any necessary modifications (if needed, as described in the following cell),
* paste it into your terminal and hit Enter.

::: {.cell .code}
```python

print(f"ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_chameleon cc@{reserved_fip}")

```

If your Chameleon key is in a different location, or has a different name, then you may need to modify the `~/.ssh/id_rsa_chameleon` part of this command to point to *your* key.

The first time you log in to each new host, your computer may display a warning similar to the following: 

```shell
The authenticity of host "129.114.26.xx (129.114.26.xx)" cannot be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:1fcbGrgLDdOeorauhz3CTyhmFqOHsrEWlu0TZ6yGoDM.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
and you will have to type the word _yes_ and hit Enter to continue. 

If you have specified your key path and other details correctly, it won’t ask you for a password when you log in to the resource. (It may ask for the passphrase for your private key if you’ve set one.)

The output of the above command will look somewhat like this.
```shell

Let's practice running a command in this remote session. Copy and paste the following command into the SSH terminal, to create a file and populate it with a "hello" message:


```shell
echo "Hello from $(hostname)" > hello.txt
```

then check the file contents:

```shell
cat hello.txt
```

Now we will use this file "hello.txt" in a later exercise, when we want to practice transferring files between the remote host and our own laptop!
